# IMDB_Dataset_Movie_Reviews
Applications and practice in neural networks(English) Project Proposal 1

# 1. Project title
### Building the Movie review classifier
# 2. Project Introduction
## 2-1. Objective
: Developing the Moview review classifier. By using this model, we could build the document classifier.
## 2-2. Motivation
: As an LLM researcher, I want to choose an NLP task. So, I picked the Movie Review Classifier task, which is a famous NLP task. I want to build two movie review classifiers, one for English and another for the Korean version. Then, I'll analyze the performances and differences between the English and Korean movie review classifiers.
# 3. IMDB Dataset Description (For English Movie Review)
## 3-1. What is IMDB Dataset?
: This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.
